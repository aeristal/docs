**Question: Are you hacking/backdooring my game? / Why is "AG\_ByteNet" being inserted into my game?**\
Answer: We will never backdoor or attempt to gain unauthorized control over your game. Some of our products may need to send/receive data from server to client and client to server, but traditional Roblox RemoteEvents/RemoteFunctions pose a performance and security risk. Therefore, we use **ByteNet**, an networking library which helps to organize events and boost performance.

ByteNet is currently not used in any of our products, but products will be shifting to ByteNet in their next updates.
