# License Transfers

Unfortunately if your Roblox account gets terminated or you lose access to it, Parcel will not be able to transfer your licenses. Don't worryâ€”we're here to help you.

Currently, license transfers are done manually by Noren while we work on a way for our customers to do so themselves at anytime.

{% hint style="success" %}
You can only request a license transfer from your own Roblox account or another Roblox account that **you own**. If you have **lost access** to your Roblox account, please contact [Roblox Support](https://roblox.com/support).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is important to understand that once you have transferred any of your licenses to another Roblox account, you will **not be able to get it back** unless the transfer recipient transfers it back to you. If you are transferring to another Roblox account that **you own**, it is crucial that you have a way to **prove your ownership** of the account or the license(s) will be stuck with that account (_see below for accepted types of proof of account ownership_).
{% endhint %}

Here's how to transfer your license(s):

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Prepare the required items

1. Names of the licenses you wish to transfer, and
2. Roblox username of the transfer recipient, or
3. Discord username of the transfer recipient, and
4. proof of account ownership (if transferring licenses from another Roblox account you own).

**Types of proof of account ownership accepted:**

* Discord account link with Roblox account (Bloxlink/Parcel/Discord connections)
* Screenshots of purchase messages from Parcel **and** dates of purchases (the purchase must've been made when the Roblox account is linked with your Discord account)
* Date **and** support ticket ID of past license transfer requests (if you transferred the licenses to the Roblox account in the past, the transfer must've been made by your Discord account)

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the licenses of a terminated Roblox account has already been transferred, no one else will be able to get the licenses. However, the new owner of the licenses can request to transfer their licenses.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### [Contact us](../contact-us.md) and request for a license transfer

Please contact us by opening a support ticket in our Discord server and state that you would like to request for a license transfer. You should also provide all your required items when the ticket channel is created.
