# License Transfers

Unfortunately if your Roblox account gets terminated or you lose access to it, Parcel will not be able to transfer your licenses. Don't worryâ€”we're here to help you.

Currently, license transfers are done manually by Noren while we work on a way for our customers to do so themselves at anytime.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please take note that you cannot request a license transfer from someone else's account. If you wish to transfer licenses from an Roblox account you own **that has been terminated**, please provide the required items as listed below.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
You can only request a license transfer from another Roblox account if it has been **terminated** and you **own the account**. If you have **lost access** to your Roblox account, please contact [Roblox Support](https://roblox.com/support).
{% endhint %}

Here's how to transfer your license(s):

{% step %}
### Prepare the required items

1. Names of the licenses you wish to transfer, and
2. Roblox username of the transfer recipient, or
3. Discord username of the transfer recipient, and
4. proof of account ownership (if receiving licenses from an terminated Roblox account you own).

**Types of proof of account ownership accepted:**

* Discord account link with Roblox account (Bloxlink/Parcel/Discord connections)
* Screenshots of purchase messages from Parcel **and** dates of purchases (the purchase must've been made when the Roblox account is linked with your Discord account)
* Date **and** support ticket ID of past license transfer requests (if you transferred the licenses to the Roblox account in the past, the transfer must've been made by your Discord account)

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the licenses of the terminated Roblox account has already been transferred, you will no longer be eligible to get the licenses. However, the new owner of the licenses can request to transfer their licenses to you.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}
