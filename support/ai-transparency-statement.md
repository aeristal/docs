# 📄 AI Transparency Statement

At Noren, we believe that artificial intelligence has the power to make us more efficient, more creative, and ultimately better at what we do. We actively encourage our team to use AI responsibly as a tool to support and enhance their work—not replace it.

Our development process embraces AI to help us overcome technical challenges, especially in areas where certain advanced features were once beyond our scripting expertise. Thanks to AI, we’ve been able to bring these ideas to life faster and more effectively, pushing the boundaries of what our products can do.

That said, AI is just one part of the equation. Every product we release undergoes rigorous testing and human oversight. Regardless of whether AI contributed to the development, our team ensures that the final output meets the high standards of quality, performance, and usability that Noren stands for.

We’re excited about the potential AI brings—and we’re committed to using it thoughtfully, transparently, and always with your experience in mind.
