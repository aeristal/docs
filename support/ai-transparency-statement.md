# ðŸ“„ AI Transparency Statement

### Introduction

At Noren, we commit to being open about the tools and technologies we use. This document outlines how AI is used in the development of our tech products, and how it benefits you, and the steps we take to ensure quality and ethical use.

### How AI Supports Our Development Processes

AI plays a role in various stages of our products' development. From assisting with debugging to optimizing code for performance, AI helps speed up our development while maintaining consistency. However, our team ensures that every piece produced reflects our brand's quality and vision.

### Benefits of Using AI

By incorporating AI into our workflow, we are able to reduce time spent on resolving bugs (\~30 mins or more), and improve the performance of our products. AI enables us to get past obstructions faster, giving us more time to focus on refining the final product to meet your needs.

### Human Oversight and Quality Control

While AI is an essential tool, it does not replace the expertise of our development team. Every AI-generated output undergoes human review to ensure that it meets our high standards. Our team is deeply involved in every step, ensuring that the final product aligns with our values and quality expectations. Our products are also tested by our team of QA testers before finalisation.

### Conclusion

At Noren, we are excited about the potential of AI and its ability to improve our products and services. But we remain dedicated to using it responsibly, ensuring that transparency, ethics, and human creativity always come first. Thank you for trusting us to deliver quality tech products that blend innovation with integrity.
