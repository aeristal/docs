# ℹ️ Terms of Use

These Terms of Use are here to make things clear and fair for everyone using digital assets ("Product"), like RBXM files, purchased directly from Noren. If you ever feel these Terms don’t work for you, no worries—you can request to cancel your license anytime (just note that refunds aren’t provided), and you’ll no longer be able to use the Product.

Products not bought directly from us (like unofficial copies) aren’t allowed under these Terms. Also, anything you buy from us through Roblox’s Creator Store is not covered by these terms.

We may update these Terms from time to time without notice, so it's a good idea to check in now and then to stay up-to-date.

## 1. How You Can Use The Product

We’re happy to offer you a non-exclusive, revocable license to use our Product for your own personal or commercial Roblox projects. To keep things fair, we ask you to:

* Please don’t resell, give away, or share the Product with others.\*
* Please don’t try to break, decompile, or remove the systems we’ve added to protect ownership or security.
* You can edit the Product for your own use, but don’t share or redistribute those edits.\*
* Please don’t use the Product to make knock-offs or anything meant to compete with the original.
* Don’t use the Product for anything illegal or unauthorized.
* Don’t intentionally make the Product look broken or in bad shape.
* Avoid creating misleading or unfair content with the Product (like false reviews or fake comparisons).
* Don’t post things just to hurt our reputation or sales.

\*This doesn't apply if you're using Team Create to work together with other developers in Roblox because other developers may save the Product as a file anyways. Don't worry, as our licensing systems will block them from using them without a license.

All scripts in the Product are protected and must not be changed or reverse-engineered.

Need to move your license to another Roblox account? Just reach out to us—it may take up to 3 days, depending on how fast we can reply and your situation.

## 2. Ownership & What's Not Allowed

The Product still belongs to Noren. You’re getting permission to use it—not full ownership.

* Sharing, leaking, or reselling the Product without our OK will lead to a warning, getting blacklisted, or losing access to the Product—depending on how serious it is.
* Please don’t try to get around any licensing systems we’ve added.

## 3. Branding & Credit

* Please don’t remove or change any branding, credits, or tags that say it's made by Noren.
* If branding is added using Parts or MeshParts, you can move it if needed—but make sure it stays visible.
* Want to add your own branding? You can only do that if:\
  • The Product has a "No Branding Surcharge" (check on our Discord catalog), or\
  • You have the "No Branding Pass."
* If you’re unsure, reach out and get written permission before making branding changes.

## 4. Keeping Things Safe

We use some smart systems inside the Product to help make sure everything’s being used the right way. These may:

* Check if the license is valid.
* Notify us if there’s suspected piracy or tampering.
* Trigger actions like warnings or revoking access if something’s wrong.

Please don't try to disable or work around these systems.

## 5. What Happens If Terms Are Broken

If someone doesn’t follow these Terms, we may give a warning, blacklist them, or remove their license to use the Product.

If you ever change your mind and want to stop using it, you can choose to cancel your access—just remember there are no refunds.

## 6. Updates

We might change these Terms occasionally. It’s your responsibility to check in once in a while and stay in the loop. If you keep using the Product after an update, that means you agree with the changes.

By using the Product, you’re agreeing to everything above. Thanks for being part of our community!
