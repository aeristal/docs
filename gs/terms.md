# ℹ️ Terms of Use

These Terms apply to digital assets, including RBXM files (‘Product’), purchased directly from Atelier Group. In the event a User does not agree to these Terms, they may request to revoke their license (without refund), therefore forfeiting all rights to use the Product.

Unofficial products (those not purchased directly from Atelier Group) are not authorized and are considered a violation of these Terms. These Terms do not apply to any products sold by Atelier Group on Roblox's Creator Store.

These Terms may change at any time without prior notice, and it is the responsibility of the User to refer to the latest version to ensure compliance.

## 5. Enforcement
